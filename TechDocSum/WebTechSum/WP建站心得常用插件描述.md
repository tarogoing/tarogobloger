8.**Syndicate Out**

Syndicates posts made in any specified category to another WP blog using WordPress' built in XML-RPC functionality.

Syndicate Out syndicates all posts made in a specified category (or optionally all posts) to any other WordPress

blog(s) in real time. This enables blog owners to create automatic aggregating, or topic specific blogs from any

number of different blog sources without relying on RSS feeds or any kind of timed events. Put simply: it re-posts

the content of one blog to one or more other blogs.

The plugin uses WordPress’ built in XML-RPC functionality to push posts to the target blog. XML-RPC will need

to be enabled on the receiving blog in order for this plugin to work. For versions of WordPress 3.5 and later

the XML-RPC is enabled by default. For versions prior to 3.5 it will need enabling in the admin panel.

For versions 0.8 and higher of the plugin the sending blog needs to be WordPress 3.1 or higher due to the use of

the WordPress enhanced IXR client, and the receiving blog needs to be WordPress 3.4 or higher so that the XML-RPC

WordPress API posts functionality is available.

More information is available, feature requests and bug reports are gladly accepted over on the

[project’s own blog](http://www.flutt.co.uk/development/wordpress-plugins/syndicate-out/).

**6.SO Pinyin Slugs**
将文章的alisa修改为拼音，解决部分主机无法显示汉字的问题

Transforms Chinese character titles (of Posts, Pages and all other content types that use slugs) into a permalink friendly slug, showing pinyin that can be read by humans and (Chinese) search engines alike.

The SO Pinyin Slugs plugin is a fork of the original  [Pinyin Permalinks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pinyin-permalink/)  plugin by user  [xiaole_tao](https://profiles.wordpress.org/xiaole_tao/)  who has seemingly abandoned his plugin as he never responded to emails.

The original plugin can basically only be used on Chinese only websites; as soon as you install it on a bi/multilingual site it messes up the slugs of the non-Chinese languages.

This fork has been adapted by my ex-colleague  [Denis Cao](https://github.com/caoyongsheng)  in such a way that the slugs of the non-Chinese language remain untouched and only the Chinese character slugs will be transformed into pinyin.

Chinese characters don’t come out good in permalinks. Without the SO Pinyin Slugs plugin activated, the example post I made for the screenshot will get a slug like this:  *%e6%90%9c%e7%b4%a2%e5%bc%95%e6%93%8e%e4%bc%98%e5%8c%96*. With the plugin the slug automatically becomes  *sousuoyinqingyouhua*.

Search engines such as  [Baidu](https://www.baidu.com/)  obviously cannot make much of the first slug, but they can handle pinyin perfectly, especially when it is written as one long string without hyphens or underscores.

So instead of transforming “中国” into two separate words divided by a hyphen or an underscore (the original plugin has this as options), it is best transformed into “zhongguo”. The only option SO Pinyin Slugs therefore has left is the length that you can limit to an x amount of letters. The default is 100, which should be plenty for most.

I have decided to only support this plugin through  [Github](https://github.com/senlin/so-pinyin-slugs/issues). Therefore, if you have any questions, need help and/or want to make a feature request, please open an issue over at Github. You can also browse through open and closed issues to find what you are looking for and perhaps even help others.

**PLEASE DO NOT POST YOUR ISSUES VIA THE WORDPRESS FORUMS**
Thanks for your understanding and cooperation.
**WPML Compatible**

The SO Pinyin Slugs plugin has received the  [WPML Certification of Compatibility](https://wpml.org/plugin/so-pinyin-slugs/).
