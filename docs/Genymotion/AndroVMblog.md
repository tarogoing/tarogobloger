Open-sourcing AndroVM
Posted on December 4, 2012 by Dan

Hi,
at least, the AndroVM source code is now available.
To get it you need the repo tool from source.android.com along with other prerequesites which are listed here.
The platform manifest git used by repo is : http://github.com/androvm/platform_manifest.git
For the moment, the only working branch is androVM-4.1.1_r6.1
Thus, to initialize your AndroVM repo you should do : repo init -u https://github.com/androvm/platform_manifest.git -b androVM-4.1.1_r6.1
If you have any patches you’d like to submit, please send them to the AndroVM Google group.
Happy coding
Dan.
