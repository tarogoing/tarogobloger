WiMo Standard Overview
Wireless Mobile Multimedia Transmission Protocol (WiMo) is a technology standard for performing wireless and realtime transmission of multimedia data (video, voice, data) between mobile terminal devices (such as mobile phones, tablet PCs, notebook computers, PSPs, digital
cameras/video cameras, etc.) and large screen display devices (such as home TVs, LCD monitors, projectors, etc.) and between mobile terminaldevices. The technology can realize sharing and interaction among mobile terminals and home televisions, projection equipment,
displays and provide users with business experience with the integration of three screens and mobile terminals as its center.
The features of WiMo include:

Low time delay: WiMo uses a variety of encoding methods and chooses different coding algorithms to meet the need of rea

time interactive services (such as games) under the support of certain bandwidth;

Low power consumption: WiMo can be applied to mobile terminals and other equipment with demanding requirement for power consumption and can support long
time business service;

High resolution: support video data with the resolution up to 1080p and 30 frames per second.
WiMo solves the problem in wireless and realtime transmission of high definition audio and video based on mobile terminals, and sets up a realtime
and interactive bridge between the mobile terminals and large screen display devices, and between mobile terminals. It allows users to enjoy a steady stream of mobile internet applications (such as games, music, video,
web browsing, etc.) in different scre ens, makes mobile terminals become a integrator of game consoles and controllers, high definition players, music players and netbooks as well as the
home information and entertainment center. WiMo breaks the shackle of smallscreen mobile
terminals. It will change the previous situation in which mobile terminals is not so popular in home use and enhance the frequency and the length of time of mobile internet application in
home use
